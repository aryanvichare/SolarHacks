Register for Solar Hacks I, taking place on October 12, 2019.

Solar Hacks is a one-day, 200-participant hackathon that is independent and unaffiliated with any school. Our goal is to bring middle and high school students in the Bay Area together to come together and develop innovative ideas that could revolutionize the world. At Solar Hacks, we provide students with the resources and mentorship that would be needed to convert their ideas into a reality. Additionally, by the end of the Hackathon, students will be able to learn how to collaborate with their peers to build STEM projects, gain presentation skills, and be inspired to continue doing things they love! Food, workshops, assistance, drinks, and swag will be provided to all participants for free!

We want all participants to enjoy their day at Solar Hacks, hence, we would encourage everybody to arrive to the Hackathon with a competitive mindset.
